This project is currently on hold.
This is a top-down arcade racing game, or at least it will be. The plan here is to make something that I (and other people) can play and share high scores with friends, nothing too serious.
By the end of the project I'm hoping to have implemented the following aspects:
- Multiple gamemodes (standard race, time trial, outlast, etc);
- Some sort of customization, even if it's just the player color;
- Multiple maps, each with day/night versions;
That's all so far. I want to add much more than that but let's get those first.
The game is planned to be entirely free, regardless of the platform I release it on.
